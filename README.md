## About

This is an ongoing project that I am using to teach myself more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I originally began working on these webpages in June 2021, which is how I selected the Pride flag and LGBTQIA+ community as the focus of my project.

## Resources

In addition to the comments in my project, I wanted to highlight the following as a very helpful resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-indian-flag-using-html-and-css/ GeeksforGeeks originally designed an animated flag of India using HTML and CSS; I then updated their code and effects as I created my own rainbow flag.

## To Do

When this project began, it was a single page about the rainbow flag. Originally I intended to use JavaScript to reveal the individual Pride flag stripe colors and meanings via hover events. I plan on coming back to this over time to make my original vision reality!

Additional To Do item's include:

-Polishing the newly added homepage<br>
-Updating the navgiation bar (which is currently an HTML-only menu)<br>
-Creating a new page focused on the individual letters and meanings of the LGBTQIA+ acronym<br/>
-Moving the CSS into an external Style Sheet, instead of using internal CSS formatting
