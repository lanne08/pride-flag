## About

This is an ongoing project that I am using to teach myself more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I originally began working on this page in June 2021, which is how I selected the Pride flag as the focus of my project.

## Resources

In addition to the comments in my project, I wanted to highlight the following as a very helpful resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-indian-flag-using-html-and-css/ GeeksforGeeks originally designed an animated flag of India using HTML and CSS; I then updated their code and effects as I created my own rainbow flag.

## To Do

Originally I intended to use JavaScript to reveal the listed information via hover events. I plan on coming back to this over time to make my original vision reality!

I am also currently in the process of deciding whether to expand on this page with the addition of more flags.
